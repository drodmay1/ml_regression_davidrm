#### Clarity & Organization
Brett’s notebook is clear, well-organized, and easy to follow. Each step—from loading data to modeling and evaluation—is broken down in a logical sequence. The clean layout and consistent formatting make the notebook very readable. The explanations alongside the code help the reader understand both the reasoning and process.

#### Feature Selection & Justification
Brett does a great job exploring the dataset and identifying important features. In particular, “smoker” clearly stands out as a strong predictor of medical costs. Other features like age and BMI are also used effectively. The feature choices make sense and are backed by both visualization and analysis.

#### Model Performance & Comparisons
The comparison between the standard linear regression model and the pipeline approach is well executed. Brett uses appropriate metrics (such as MAE, MSE, and R²) to evaluate model performance, and the side-by-side results give a complete picture. This adds depth and professionalism to the analysis.

#### Reflection Quality and Constructive Suggestion
The reflection is thoughtful and shows Brett’s understanding of the modeling process. One suggestion would be to try training a simplified model using only the top 2–3 features—such as smoker, age, and BMI—to see if a lighter model could perform nearly as well. This could add an extra layer of insight into the value of those features.

#### Summary
Overall, this is a strong and professional notebook. Brett demonstrates a solid grasp of data exploration, feature selection, regression modeling, and evaluation. The work is clear, well-explained, and easy to learn from. Excellent job.
