This was a really clear and well-structured notebook! I liked how Brett walked through the entire process step by step — it made it super easy to follow. Brett's visualizations were clean, and I liked how Brett compared both the linear regression and pipeline models side by side using metrics. That made the results feel more complete and professional.

One Small Suggestion:
Since smoker status stood out as such an important feature, it might’ve been interesting to try training one model with only the top 2–3 features (like smoker, age, and BMI) to see if a simpler model could perform just as well. 

Great job. Brett clearly understood the assignment, and his notebook shows that Brett knows how to explore, clean, model, and evaluate real-world data.
